The ambitious goal is to try to identify some of the great ideas that have significantly influenced the field and have helped to make computing so pervasive. We will concentrate on mathematical, algorithmic and software ideas with the understanding that the importance and usefulness of these ideas depends upon (and often parallels) the remarkable ideas and progress in computing and communications hardware. As we will see, many of the great ideas were against the ""prevailing opinion"". The list of topics we shall discuss will depend to some degree on the background and interests of the class.

CSC197H1|What, Who, How: Privacy in the Age of Big Data Collection|The rapid advance of technology has brought remarkable changes to how we conduct our daily lives, from how we communicate, consume news and data, and purchase goods. As we increase our online activity, so too do we increase the amount of personal data that we're sharing, often without realizing it. The questions of exactly what data is being collected, who is collecting and accessing this data, and how this data is being used, have significant implications for both individuals and our larger social and political institutions. Organized by a wide variety of case studies drawn from current events, we'll study how personal data can be collected and tracked, how personal and social factors may influence our own decisions about whether and how much to share our data, and what broader political and legal tools are used to either protect or subvert individual privacy.

MAT135H1|Calculus I|In this first introduction to Calculus, students will be introduced to the tools of differential calculus, the branch of calculus that is motivated by the problem of measuring how quantities change. Students will use these tools to solve other problems, including simplifying functions with straight lines, describing how different types of change are related, and computing maximum and minimum quantities. This course will focus on developing a deep understanding of why the tools of calculus make sense and how to apply them to the social, biological, and physical sciences. It will also emphasize translating between algebraic, graphical, numerical and verbal descriptions of each concept studied. This course will be useful for students interested in learning applied calculus in relation to future studies in economics, life science, and physical and mathematical science programs. The following concepts will be studied: Limits, asymptotes, continuity, derivatives, linear approximation of functions, the notion of a differential equation (DE) and a solution of a DE, slope fields, and Euler's method.|The Physical and Mathematical Universes (5)|High school level calculus||MAT135H5/ MAT136H5/ MAT135Y5/ MATA30H3/ MATA31H3/ MATA36H3/ APS162H1/ APS163H1/ ESC194H1/ ESC195H1/ MAT186H1/ MAT187H1/ MAT196H1/ MAT197H1
MAT136H1|Calculus II|This second part of the introductory Calculus sequence focuses on integral calculus beginning with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the connection between two seemingly unrelated problems: measuring changing quantities and finding areas of curved shapes. Students will develop a deep understanding of the integral, and use it to: unpack equations involving derivatives; to make sense of infinite sums; to write complicated functions as 'infinite polynomials'; and to compute areas, volumes, and totals in applied problems. This course will further develop students' abilities to translate between algebraic, graphical, numerical, and verbal descriptions of mathematics in a variety of applied contexts. This course is a continuation of MAT135H1 and will be useful for students interested in learning applied calculus in relation to future studies in economics, life science, and physical and mathematical science programs.

The intention will be to discuss a number of the topics in Pedersen's textbook Analysis Now. Students will be encouraged to lecture on some of the material, and also to work through some of the exercises in the textbook (or in the suggested reference books). Joint undergraduate/graduate course - MAT436H1/MAT1011H|The Physical and Mathematical Universes (5)|5.0 MAT credits, including MAT224H1/ MAT247H1 and MAT237Y1/ MAT257Y1||
MAT437H1|K-Theory and C* Algebras|The theory of operator algebras was begun by John von Neumann eighty years ago. In one of the most important innovations of this theory, von Neumann and Murray introduced a notion of equivalence of projections in a self-adjoint algebra (*-algebra) of Hilbert space operators that was compatible with addition of orthogonal projections (also in matrix algebras over the algebra), and so gave rise to an abelian semigroup, now referred to as the Murray-von Neumann semigroup. Later, Grothendieck in geometry, Atiyah and Hirzebruch in topology, and Serre in the setting of arbitrary rings (pertinent for instance for number theory), considered similar constructions. The enveloping group of the semigroup considered in each of these settings is now referred to as the K-group (Grothendieck's terminology), or as the Grothendieck group. Among the many indications of the depth of this construction was the discovery of Atiyah and Hirzebruch that Bott periodicity could be expressed in a simple way using the K-group. Also, Atiyah and Singer famously showed that K-theory was important in connection with the Fredholm index. Partly because of these developments, K-theory very soon became important again in the theory of operator algebras. (And in turn, operator algebras became increasingly important in other branches of mathematics.) The purpose of this course is to give a general, elementary, introduction to the ideas of K-theory in the operator algebra context. (Very briefly, K-theory generalizes the notion of dimension of a vector space.) The course will begin with a description of the method (K-theoretical in spirit) used by Murray and von Neumann to give a rough initial classification of von Neumann algebras (into types I, II, and III). It will centre around the relatively recent use of K-theory to study Bratteli's approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebras---both to classify them (a result that can be formulated and proved purely algebraically), and to prove that the class of these C*-algebras---what Bratteli called AF algebras---is closed under passing to extensions (a result that uses the Bott periodicity feature of K-theory). Students will be encouraged to prepare oral or written reports on various subjects related to the course, including basic theory and applications.
